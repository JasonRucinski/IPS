Impedance Positioning System

Idea: Create an AC impedence-based positioning system. Electrical currents in 3-axis configuration create an impedance field within a conducting saline tank that can be read by electrode. Esentially an engineering one-off, proof-of-concept of an impedance based cardiac mapping system.

Systems needed to develop:

Easy/trivial

1) Saline tank - plexiglass container filled with saline

2) surface electrodes - repurpose old electrodes

3) positioning electrode - repurpose old catheter

nontrivial

1)
